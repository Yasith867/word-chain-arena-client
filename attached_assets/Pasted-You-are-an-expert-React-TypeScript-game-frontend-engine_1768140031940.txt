You are an expert React + TypeScript game frontend engineer.

Create a BRAND NEW Vite + React + TypeScript project from scratch and build a complete, clean, multi-page real-time multiplayer word-chain game frontend. This project must be backend-ready for a Linera microchain smart contract, but currently uses mock logic.

====================================
GAME OVERVIEW
====================================

Game name: Word Chain Rush (or any suitable name)

Description:
A fast-paced real-time multiplayer word chain game where players race to submit words. Each word must start with the last letter of the previous word. The game runs for 5 rounds, with only 5 seconds per round. First valid answer wins the point.

====================================
CORE GAME RULES
====================================

- Host counts as a player.
- Minimum total players to start: 2 (host + 1).
- Maximum total players: 4.
- Total rounds per game: 5.
- Each round lasts 5 seconds.
- Each round starts with a DIFFERENT starting word.
- Words can be ANY length (no min/max length).
- ONLY validation rule:
  First letter of submitted word must equal last letter of current word.
- First valid answer wins the round and gets +1 point.
- If no one answers within 5 seconds, no points are awarded.

====================================
REQUIRED PAGES (STRICT ORDER)
====================================

PAGE 1 — HOME / LANDING PAGE
- Show the game name prominently.
- Short description of what the game does.
- Bullet points explaining gameplay:
  - 2–4 players
  - Real-time
  - 5 rounds, 5 seconds each
- One main glowing button:
  “Play Now”
- Clean, premium look. No lobby content here.

------------------------------------

PAGE 2 — PLAYER CUSTOMIZATION PAGE
- Player MUST enter a username.
- Input field: “Enter your username”.
- Continue button:
  - Disabled until a username is entered.
- Store username in global app state.
- If username is empty, user cannot proceed.

------------------------------------

PAGE 3 — PARTY / LOBBY PAGE
Purpose: Create or join a game.

This page MUST NOT look cluttered.

Section A — Play with Friends (Real Players Mode)
- Button: “Create Real Game”
- When clicked:
  - Generate a MOCK Game ID (example: ABC123).
  - Show an invite link like:
    https://yourapp/join/ABC123
- Players can ONLY join using a Game ID.
- DO NOT auto-add fake players.
- Player list shows usernames.
- Player limit: 2–4.
- Start Game button:
  - Only visible to host.
  - Enabled only when total players >= 2.

Section B — Play with Bot (Offline Mode)
- Clearly separated card.
- Button text:
  “Don’t have friends online? Try playing with Alice (Bot)”
- Alice Bot joins ONLY if this option is selected.
- Bot mode does NOT generate a Game ID.

------------------------------------

PAGE 4 — GAME START COUNTDOWN PAGE
- Full-screen countdown animation:
  5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → START
- No inputs allowed during countdown.
- After countdown ends, transition to gameplay.

------------------------------------

PAGE 5 — GAMEPLAY + LIVE SCOREBOARD
GAMEPLAY VIEW:
- Show current word in large text.
- Show round counter (Round X / 5).
- Show 5-second countdown timer.
- Word input field for player answers.
- Disable input if:
  - Timer reaches 0
  - Player already submitted this round
- Alice Bot behavior:
  - Responds after 1–3 seconds.
  - Always submits valid words.
  - Sometimes loses (not perfect).

LIVE SCOREBOARD VIEW (after final round):
- Sort players by score (highest first).
- Highlight the winner.
- Show all usernames and scores.
- Buttons:
  - “Play Again”
  - “Back to Home”

====================================
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
====================================

- Use React with TypeScript (Vite).
- Use React hooks only.
- No external UI libraries.
- Use simple CSS or inline styles.
- Use clean card-based layout.
- Use glowing / gradient buttons for main actions.
- No “all-in-one” page layouts.
- Each page must be visually distinct.
- Keep code readable and well-commented.

====================================
BACKEND-READY REQUIREMENTS
====================================

- Add clear comments like:
  // This will be replaced by Linera backend logic
- Game ID logic must be designed to be replaced by on-chain IDs.
- Player actions must be structured so they can later be replaced by:
  - Linera contract calls
  - Subscriptions
  - Cross-chain events

====================================
OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
====================================

- Generate ALL required files.
- Ensure the app runs immediately in Replit.
- The UI must follow the 5-page flow exactly.
- No fake auto-joining players in real-player mode.
- No hard-coded starting words like “apple”.
- Each round must start with a different word.

This project should look like a REAL GAME PRODUCT, not a demo.
